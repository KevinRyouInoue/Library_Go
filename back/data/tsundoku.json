        "Description": "Vue Native is a framework to create native mobile applications for Android and IOS using JavaScript, specifically Vue; with this technology we can create good quality mobile applications. Another fundamental point is that Vue Native uses the React Native code for each of the components that we have to create our applications; therefore, Vue Native communicates directly with the React Native core to be able to display through components, images, texts, buttons, lists, and much more. The fundamental window that this platform has is that we can use the Vue and React Naive plugins to create our applications. Unfortunately this technology was obsolete at the time of writing this book; therefore, the book does not have all the chapters that were initially thought and it remains as a reference to start with this framework. However, even if it is obsolete or deprecated, it helps us to know everything that this tool offers us, we can use it to encourage us to develop in similar frameworks such as React Native, Galio, among others. As a recommendation, use Visual Studio Code as editor, since it is an excellent editor, with many customization options, extensions, intuitive, light and that you can develop in a lot of platforms, technologies, frameworks and programming languages; so overall Visual Studio Code will be a great companion for you; but, if you prefer other editors like Sublime Text, PHPStorm or similar, you can use it without any problem. Chapters This book has a total of 8 chapters, it is recommended that you read in the order in which they are arranged and as we explain the components of the framework, go directly to the practice, replicate, test and modify the codes that we show in this book. Chapter 1: It explains what is the necessary software, and its installation to develop in Vue Native. Chapter 2: We'll talk about Vue Native technology, create a project, and do some very basic testing. Chapter 3: We will give a detailed explanation of each of the most used components in Vue Native. Chapter 4: We will use a plugin to enable navigation between screens and see its practical use. Chapter 5: We will see the different ways to work with the styles in a project in Vue Native. Chapter 6: We will create a listing app consuming a Rest API on the Internet. Chapter 7: We will see the use of animations in Vue Native in a basic way along with tweens. Chapter 8: We will create a CRUD type application with forms, lists, several pages, validations, confirmation messages and redirections. Who is this book for This book is for anyone who wants to get started with mobile development and knows the basics of Vue. For those who want to know the framework and who know Vue, who want to know current frameworks similar to this one, but do not have the necessary knowledge to venture into these because they do not know the bases that support them. For those people who want to learn something new, learn about a framework that has very little documentation, who want to improve a skill in web development, who want to grow as a developer and who want to continue climbing their path with others frameworks superior to this; As long as you meet at least some of the above considerations, this book is for you.",

        "Description": "Vue is a versatile framework used in creating SPA-type websites; It is a modular, component-based technology where a component can be seen as a small piece of code and we can group components together to create more complex components. Vue is a small, simple and lightweight framework if we compare it with other frameworks like React or Angular, but its simplicity gives us windows like: Less steep learning curve than your competition. The framework is smaller than the competition (about 470 KB and 18 KB minified). It is a versatile framework which means that it can be used together with other solutions such as typescript. It is a reactive framework, which means that when your data model is updated the view is updated and vice versa. Vue is a progressive framework, which means that we can extend it through other officially supported plugins such as Vuex, Router, Testing, among others. This book is mostly practical, we will learn the basics of Vue, knowing its main features based on a small application that we will expand chapter after chapter. This book consists of 5 chapters, with which we will learn in detail the most important and basic features of Vue in version 3: Chapter 1: In this chapter we are going to learn about the basic features of Vue such as its main features, installation modes and project creation, we will make a hello world to present the main features of the web framework. Chapter 2: In this chapter we are going to learn about the 3 blocks of Vue, script block, template and style, in addition to creating small examples to present the main features of Vue. Chapter 3: In this chapter we are going to create our first CRUD type project using Vue and an existing CRUD type Rest Api; that is, a Rest Api with a limited scope using with Oruga UI as a component-based client-side web framework. Chapter 4: In this chapter we are going to create another CRUD type application in Vue using Naive UI instead of Oruga UI as a component-based web framework. Chapter 5: In this chapter we are going to create an application with Pinia and learn how to use this state manager and understand its components, which are the store, state, actions and getters. About the Book This guide is intended to take your first steps with Vue 3 using JavaScript; with this, we are going to propose two things: It is not a book that aims to know 100% of Vue in its version 3, or from zero to expert, since it would be too big an objective for the scope of this guide, otherwise, to know what it offers us and create the first web applications with Vue, know the use of components, hooks among other features of the framework. It is assumed that the reader has at least basic knowledge of JavaScript, HTML and CSS. This book has a practical approach, knowing the key aspects of the technology and moving into practice, gradually implementing small features of an application that has real scope. To follow this book you need to have a computer with Windows, Linux or MacOS. The book is currently in development. This book is currently in development and will have more chapters both at the end and in intermediate chapters; The book has two chapters taken from other books (Laravel and Django) that were adapted for this book.",

        "Description": "This book is about writing software that makes the most effective use of the system you're running on -- code that interfaces directly with the kernel and core system libraries, including the shell, text editor, compiler, debugger, core utilities, and system daemons. The majority of both Unix and Linux code is still written at the system level, and Linux System Programming focuses on everything above the kernel, where applications such as Apache, bash, cp, vim, Emacs, gcc, gdb, glibc, ls, mv, and X exist. Written primarily for engineers looking to program (better) at the low level, this book is an ideal teaching tool for any programmer. Even with the trend toward high-level development, either through web software (such as PHP) or managed code (C#), someone still has to write the PHP interpreter and the C# virtual machine. Linux System Programming gives you an understanding of core internals that makes for better code, no matter where it appears in the stack. Debugging high-level code often requires you to understand the system calls and kernel behavior of your operating system, too. Key topics include: An overview of Linux, the kernel, the C library, and the C compiler Reading from and writing to files, along with other basic file I/O operations, including how the Linux kernel implements and manages file I/O Buffer size management, including the Standard I/O library Advanced I/O interfaces, memory mappings, and optimization techniques The family of system calls for basic process management Advanced process management, including real-time processes File and directories-creating, moving, copying, deleting, and managing them Memory management -- interfaces for allocating memory, managing the memory youhave, and optimizing your memory access Signals and their role on a Unix system, plus basic and advanced signal interfaces Time, sleeping, and clock management, starting with the basics and continuing through POSIX clocks and high resolution timers With Linux System Programming, you will be able to take an in-depth look at Linux from both a theoretical and an applied perspective as you cover a wide range of programming topics.",
